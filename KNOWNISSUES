
Problem: POPART does not compile with ordinary Java/Eclipse.
This is because of a Groovy problem, with cyclic dependencies with Java classes. 
Groovy must be compiled before Java, but Java needs some Groovy classes.

Solution: Use Ant build process.

Problem: Java out of memory error during compilation 

Solution: One has to adjust the memory available for compilation: 
1) Window -> preferences -> java -> installed JREs 
2) Select the (default) VM used executing Ant from the list. 
3) Press "Edit..." and set "Default arguments" to -Xmx256M
